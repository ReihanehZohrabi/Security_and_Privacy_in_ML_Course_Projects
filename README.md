# Security and Privacy in Machine Learning Course Projects

Welcome to the repository for my Security and Privacy in Machine Learning course projects! This repository contains practical projects I completed during the [Security and Privacy in Machine Learning](https://spml-sut.github.io/) course taught by Dr. Amir Mahdi Sadeghzadeh.

## Course Information

- **Course Website:** [Security and Privacy in Machine Learning](https://spml-sut.github.io/)
- **Instructor:** Dr. Amir Mahdi Sadeghzadeh

## Course Outline

The course was divided into three main parts, each focusing on specific aspects of security and privacy in machine learning:

### Part 1: Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks
- Introduction to machine learning.
- Deep neural networks.
- Convolutional neural networks.

### Part 2: Evasion Attacks and Defenses, Poisoning Attacks and Defenses
- Evasion attacks and defense mechanisms.
- Poisoning attacks and defense strategies.
- Project presentations related to evasion and poisoning attacks.

### Part 3: Model Extraction Attacks and Defenses, Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning
- Model extraction attacks and defense techniques.
- Privacy-preserving deep learning methods.
- Project presentations related to model extraction and privacy-preserving techniques.
